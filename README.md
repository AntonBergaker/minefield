# Minefield
A phone, specifically android version of a classic game with a similar name.
Was annoyed I couldn't find any version with decent controls that didn't make me accidentlyclick the damn mine everytime I tried to flag.

Made in GameMaker Studio 2 for Android. Could probably work on iOS.

## Features
* Controls that don't suck
* Nice modern design

Couldn't find an Android version that didn't make me accidently click the damn bomb everytime I tried to flag.

Made in GameMaker Studio 2 for Android. Could probably work on iOS.

## Features
* Controls that makes it really hard to mess up
* Nice modern design
* Optimized to not drain too much battery
